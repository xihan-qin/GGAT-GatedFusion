# Gated-Graph-Attention-for-Disease-Comorbidity

In this work, we propose a Gated Graph Attention Network (GGAT) framework for
interactome-based disease comorbidity prediction. GGAT performs topology-aware
local attention over protein–protein interaction networks and incorporates
gating mechanisms to regulate information flow and stabilize representation
learning on noisy biological graphs. In addition, a multichannel fusion strategy
integrates protein connectivity and disease association signals to capture
complementary biological information. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GGAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
Transformer-based baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, highlighting
its effectiveness and flexibility for modeling disease–disease relationships.
