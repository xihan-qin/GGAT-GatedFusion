# Multichannel-Gated-Graph-Attention-Networks-for-Disease-Comorbidity

In this work, we propose a Gated Graph Attention Network (GGAT) framework for
interactome-based disease comorbidity prediction. GGAT performs topology-aware
local attention over protein–protein interaction networks and incorporates
gating mechanisms to regulate information flow and stabilize representation
learning on noisy biological graphs. In addition, a multichannel fusion strategy
integrates protein connectivity and disease association signals to capture
complementary biological information. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GGAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
Transformer-based baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, highlighting
its effectiveness and flexibility for modeling disease–disease relationships.


## Models and Usage
This project is designed to be run in Google Colab. All dependencies are handled
within the notebooks. To reproduce the experiments, open the notebooks in Google
Colab, mount your Google Drive, and update the project root path in the notebook
to your own Drive location. 

Specifically, in the *Mount Drive* block:
```python
os.chdir('/content/drive/My Drive/Colab_Notebooks/[your-project-root]')
```

### GGAT Single-Channel Models

The notebook `GGAT_singlechannel.ipynb` implements GGAT single-channel models, including:

- **GGAT-Connect** (`model_type = "n2v"`)
- **GGAT-Disease** (`model_type = "label"`)

#### Runtime Notes
- The default number of training epochs is **3000**, which requires a GPU and takes
  approximately **9 hours** to complete on Google Colab.
- For users who only want to **verify that the code runs correctly** or to
  **inspect the model design**, the number of epochs can be reduced (e.g., `epochs = 1`),
  in which case the notebook will finish within a few minutes.
- Full-length training is only required to **reproduce the reported performance**.

### GGAT-GatedFusion Model

The notebook `GGAT_fusion.ipynb` implements the **GGAT-GatedFusion** model.

#### Important Notes
- This notebook requires **pre-trained single-channel GGAT checkpoints** produced by
  `GGAT_singlechannel.ipynb` (saved as `.pt` files containing model parameters).
- In `GGAT_fusion.ipynb`, the single-channel models are **loaded from these `.pt` checkpoints**
  and the corresponding **node representations (embeddings) are computed via a forward pass**
  before being used as inputs to the fusion model.

For convenience and reproducibility, the required single-channel `.pt` checkpoints are
provided in this repository, allowing users to run the fusion notebook without re-training
the single-channel models.

## Additional Implementation Details (Supplementary to the Manuscript)

### Standard Multi-Head GAT Formulation

For completeness, we briefly summarize the standard multi-head GAT updates used inside each GGAT layer. For the $k$-th head at
layer $l$, the unnormalized attention score $e_{ij}^{l,(k)}$ between node $i$
and a neighbor $j \in \mathcal{N}(i)$ is

Unnormalized attention score:
eᶫ,ᵏᵢⱼ = LeakyReLU( (aᶫ,ᵏ)ᵀ · [ Wᶫ,ᵏ hᶫᵢ  ∥  Wᶫ,ᵏ hᶫⱼ ] )

Normalized attention coefficient:
αᶫ,ᵏᵢⱼ = exp(eᶫ,ᵏᵢⱼ) / ∑ₘ∈𝒩(i) exp(eᶫ,ᵏᵢₘ)

Head-specific node representation:
uᶫ,ᵏᵢ = ELU( ∑ⱼ∈𝒩(i) αᶫ,ᵏᵢⱼ · hᶫⱼ )

Multi-head concatenation:
xᶫᵢ = ∥ₖ₌₁ᴷ uᶫ,ᵏᵢ

Here, $\mathbf{W}^{l,(k)} \in \mathbb{R}^{F' \times F}$ is the head-specific
projection matrix and $\Vert$ denotes concatenation.

For the $k$-th head, node features
$\mathbf{h}_i^{l,(k)}, \mathbf{h}_j^{l,(k)} \in \mathbb{R}^{F'}$ represent the
projected embeddings of node $i$ and its neighbor $j$, and $\mathcal{N}(i)$
denotes the neighborhood of node $i$. The unnormalized attention score
$e_{ij}^{l,(k)}$ for edge $(i,j)$ is computed by applying a learnable vector
$\mathbf{a}^{l,(k)} \in \mathbb{R}^{2F'}$ to the concatenated projected features
of nodes $i$ and $j$. The score $e_{ij}^{l,(k)}$ is then normalized across all
neighbors to produce attention weights $\alpha_{ij}^{l,(k)}$. The weighted
neighbor features are aggregated and passed through an ELU activation to yield
the head-specific representation, which are subsequently concatenated across
heads.

### Prediction Layer and Loss

Given a disease–pair representation $P_p$, the predictor is a two-layer MLP with
ReLU activation,

$$
\ell_p
=
\mathbf{w}_4^{\top}
\rho\!\big(
\mathbf{W}_3 \rho(\mathbf{P}_p)
\big),
$$

$$
\hat{y}_p
=
\sigma(\ell_p).
$$

where $\rho(\cdot)$ is ReLU and $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid. The model is
trained with the standard binary cross-entropy loss,

$$
\mathcal{L}_p
=
- y_p \log \sigma(\ell_p)
- (1 - y_p) \log\!\big( 1 - \sigma(\ell_p) \big).
$$

where $y_p \in \{0,1\}$ is the ground-truth comorbidity label.

### Training and Experimental Settings

We perform stratified 10-fold cross-validation on the 10,743 disease–disease
pairs, preserving the positive/negative comorbidity ratio in each fold. In each
run, nine folds are used for training and one fold is held out for testing; the
test fold is never used during model selection or early stopping. All models are
trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005 and weight decay
of $5 \times 10^{-4}$. Single-channel GGAT models are trained for 3000 epochs,
while the GatedFusion variant is trained for 2000 epochs. All hyperparameters
are summarized below. Experiments are conducted in the Google Colab environment
on an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU with CUDA 12 support.
